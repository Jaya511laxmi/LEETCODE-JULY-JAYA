# ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Find the Original Typed String I

LeetCode Problem: [3330. Find the Original Typed String I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i/)  
Difficulty: Easy  
Topic Tags: String, Counting, Two Pointers

## Problem Summary

Alice is typing a string but may press a key for too long, causing one character to repeat multiple times.  
This could happen **at most once** throughout the entire string.

You're given the final typed string. Return the **total number of possible original strings** Alice might have meant to type.
### Example 
**Input:** `"abbcccc"`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:**

The possible original strings are:
- "abbcccc"
- "abbccc"
- "abbcc"
- "abbc"
- "abcccc"

## My Approach

- Traverse the string and **group consecutive characters** using two pointers.
- For each group of repeated characters:
  - If the group length is `k`, Alice may have intended any length from `1` to `k`.
  - But since Alice made this typing mistake **at most once**, we can apply this shortening to only one group.
- So, for each group of length `>1`, we count `(k - 1)` **extra possibilities**.
- Total possibilities = `1 (no mistake)` + `sum of (groupLen - 1)` for each group with length > 1.
